This roadmap is designed specifically for a **Python-proficient** student in their 3rd year. Since you are in a Tier-3 college, we will focus on a 5-month plan that not only covers DSA but also builds the **"extra" profile** needed to beat the competition.

### Monthly Roadmap (The "Placement-Ready" Path)

---

### Month 1: Foundation & Linear DSA (The "Starter" Phase)

**Goal:** Master Python-specific DSA and solve ~50 "Easy" problems.

* **Week 1: Analysis & Basics:** Time/Space Complexity (Big-O). Master Python’s `collections.deque` (for queues) and `heapq` (for heaps).
* **Week 2: Arrays:** Two Pointers, Sliding Window, and Prefix Sum.
* **Week 3: Strings & Hashing:** Anagrams, Palindromes, and Frequency counting using Dictionaries.
* **Week 4: Linked Lists:** Singly, Doubly, and Circular. Practice "Fast & Slow Pointer" logic.

**Where to learn:** * **Concepts:** [NeetCode's Python DSA for Beginners](https://neetcode.io/courses/lessons/python-for-coding-interviews) (Excellent visual explanations).

* **Practice:** [Striver’s A2Z Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/dsa/strivers-a2z-sheet-learn-dsa-a-to-z) (Steps 1–6).

### Month 2: Sorting, Searching & Recursion (The "Logic" Phase)

**Goal:** Move to "Medium" problems and build deep recursive thinking.

* **Week 5: Sorting & Searching:** Binary Search (BS) is critical. Learn BS on answer spaces (not just arrays).
* **Week 6: Recursion:** Subsets, Permutations, and Combination Sum.
* **Week 7: Stacks & Queues:** Monotonic Stack (the "Next Greater Element" pattern).
* **Week 8: Bit Manipulation & Greedy:** XOR tricks and choosing local optima.

**Where to learn:**

* **Concepts:** [Aditya Verma's Recursion Playlist](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPL_z_8CaSLPWeT1ffjiImo0sQW9kHndW9k) (Logic building is top-tier).
* **Practice:** [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) (Binary Search & Stack sections).

---

### Month 3: Non-Linear DSA (The "Interview Heavy" Phase)

**Goal:** 60% of technical interviews focus on these topics.

* **Week 9-10: Trees:** Binary Trees, BSTs, and traversals (Iterative & Recursive). Focus on "LCA" and "Diameter" problems.
* **Week 11: Heaps & Priority Queues:** K-way merging and Top K Frequent elements.
* **Week 12: Graphs (Basics):** Representation (Adjacency list), BFS, and DFS.

**Where to learn:**

* **Concepts:** [Striver’s Tree Series](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLgUwDviBHe0oEiy7u_v92-9447e_3675N) (Universal gold standard).
* **Practice:** LeetCode "Top Interview 150" (Trees & Heaps).

---

### Month 4: Advanced Algorithms (The "High Package" Phase)

**Goal:** Cracking the 10-15 LPA+ roles.

* **Week 13-14: Graphs (Advanced):** Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford, Topological Sort (Kahn's), and Disjoint Set Union (DSU).
* **Week 15-16: Dynamic Programming (DP):** Start with 1D (Stairs, Robber) then 2D (Knapsack, LCS, LIS). Don't rush this.

**Where to learn:**

* **Concepts:** [Striver’s Graph Series](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLgUwDviBHe0oUr34p9Y6S77C57E6zG2c1) and [DP Series](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLgUwDviBHe0qBfQx48-4vY4M0l6X08_5Z).
* **Practice:** [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) (DP & Graphs).

---

### Month 5: Mock Tests & Core CS (The "Closure" Phase)

**Goal:** Transition from learning to competing.

* **Week 17-18: Core CS Fundamentals:** Revise **DBMS (SQL)**, **Operating Systems**, and **OOPS in Python**. Service-based and Product-based companies *always* ask these.
* **Week 19-20: Mock Assessments:** * Solve 2 "Contests" on LeetCode every weekend.
* Solve previous year company papers on **GeeksforGeeks**.



**Where to learn:**

* **Core CS:** [Love Babbar’s OS/DBMS Playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@LoveBabbar) or [Knowledge Gate](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/%40knowledgegate).

### Pro-Tips for Tier-3 Students

1. **Github Consistency:** Commit your daily LeetCode solution to a GitHub repo. It proves to recruiters that you are consistent.
2. **LinkedIn Networking:** Once you finish Month 3, start reaching out to seniors for **referrals**.
3. **Project Balance:** Since you know Python, build 1 high-quality project (Web Scraper, Bot, or API) to complement your DSA skills on your resume.
